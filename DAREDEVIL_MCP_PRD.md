# DAREDEVIL MCP-READY PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the transformation of the DAREDEVIL sports betting platform into an **MCP-ready (Model Context Protocol) system** that enables fully agentic betting through natural language interactions. Users will only need to specify bet amount, team/driver, and sign transactions - the AI assistant will handle all intermediate steps autonomously.

**Vision**: Create the world's most intuitive sports betting experience where users can place bets through conversational AI, with built-in expert guidance and social sharing capabilities.

## Target MCP-Ready Architecture

### Model Context Protocol Integration
```typescript
interface MCPBettingAgent {
  // Core MCP capabilities
  understandNaturalLanguage(message: string): BettingIntent
  generateGuidingQuestions(context: BettingContext): QuestionFlow
  createAutonomousMatch(data: MatchCriteria): Match
  generateBetMetadata(bet: Bet, match: Match): BetMetadata
  createQRInvite(betId: string): QRCodeData
  provideExpertAdvice(context: BettingContext): AdviceResponse
}
```

### Agentic Betting Flow
The AI assistant will act as a fully autonomous betting agent that:
- Parses natural language to understand betting intent
- Guides users through missing information with contextual questions
- Automatically generates match data and bet metadata
- Creates blockchain transactions autonomously
- Provides expert risk assessment and advice

### Enhanced User Journey

## Agentic Betting Implementation

### 1. Natural Language Processing
```typescript
interface BettingIntent {
  amount: number
  currency: string
  competitor: string
  sport?: string
  matchCriteria?: MatchCriteria
  riskTolerance?: 'conservative' | 'moderate' | 'aggressive'
}

interface QuestionFlow {
  questions: GuidingQuestion[]
  context: BettingContext
  completionPercentage: number
}

interface GuidingQuestion {
  id: string
  question: string
  type: 'selection' | 'confirmation' | 'input'
  options?: string[]
  required: boolean
}
```

### 2. Autonomous Match Generation
The AI will automatically create matches when sufficient criteria are provided:
- **Sport Detection**: "Lakers vs Warriors" â†’ NBA basketball
- **Competitor Resolution**: Team names, driver names, abbreviations
- **Match Creation**: Auto-generate match ID, metadata, and scheduling
- **Data Validation**: Cross-reference with existing match data

### 3. Intelligent Guidance System
The AI will ask contextual questions to fill information gaps:
```typescript
const guidanceExamples = {
  missingAmount: "How much would you like to bet?",
  missingCompetitor: "Which team or driver are you betting on?",
  missingSport: "Are you betting on basketball, football, or Formula 1?",
  riskAssessment: "This appears to be a high-risk bet. Would you like expert advice?",
  confirmation: "Confirm: $50 on Lakers to beat Warriors. Ready to proceed?"
}
```
